# SimpleSnake
The unforgettable Nokia Snake Game, reconstructed in a simple Visual Studio Console App (using C#). 

Collect food (asterik, dollar sign and hash) by moving up, down, left & right with the corresponding key arrows.

The Asterik symbol (*) is worth 1 point (increases the snake by 1 dot). 

The Dollar Sign symbol ($) is worth 2 point (increases the snake by 2 dots).

The Hash symbol (#) is worth 3 point (increases the snake by 3 dots).

The goal of this game is to survive and grow for as long as possible while avoiding the walls and biting yourself.

Enjoy!
